# Constitution of The Federal Republic of Discordia

## Article I

The legislative power shall be vested into two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate.

### Section 1

The House of Representatives will be comprised of representatives proportional to the number of registered citizens currently legally residing in the FRD, and elected every 2 weeks by the people of each state.

The actual enumeration of the people living therein will be completed within 4 weeks of the first session of Congress and will be recounted every 6 weeks. Until the actual enumeration, there will be 1 representative for every 2 people in each state. The legislature of each state will be tasked with drawing the actual map based on the population therein. The state legislatures shall have the power to divide their members into any districts as they see fit, given that these groups do not violate any other section of this constitution.

No person who has not been a citizen of the FRD for at least 4 weeks, who does not currently reside in the district they would represent, who has been convicted of a high crime or misdemeanor, or barred from office by a federal court shall be a representative.

The House of Representatives shall choose its officers.

The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment, which may be used against an official of another branch in cases of high crimes and/or misdemeanors.

### Section 2

The Senate shall be composed of 2 senators for each of the states in the union, elected every 6 weeks by the people of each state.

Immediately following the first election to the Senate, the senators will be divided into 3 groups at random. The 1st group shall serve for 2 weeks, the 2nd shall serve for 4 weeks, and the 3rd shall serve for 6 weeks. After these terms, the standard 6 week term will come into effect.

No person who has not been a citizen of the FRD for at least 8 weeks, who does not currently reside in the state they would represent, who has been convicted of a high crime or misdemeanor, or barred from office by a federal court shall be a senator.

The Vice President will be the Speaker of the Senate but will have no vote unless they are equally divided.

The Senate shall choose its officers, and a Speaker pro tempore, who shall serve as the Speaker when the Vice President is not present.

The Senate shall have the power to try all impeachment, and when they are sitting for this purpose, they shall do so under oath. When the President or Vice President is being tried, the Chief Justice of the FRD will preside. With 2/3rds concurrence of all senators, the officer will be convicted. Conviction by the Senate will result in the removal of the officer from office. On conviction, the Senate may also choose to disqualify the officer from being able to again hold federal office.

### Section 3

The manner in which elections be conducted shall be decided by the States in the union and the legislatures therein, granted that these elections do not violate any other provision of this constitution.

Congress shall meet at least once a week on Wednesday, or another day as prescribed by law or resolution.

### Section 4

Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.

Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.

Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.

Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting. 

### Section 5

No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the FRD, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the FRD, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office. 

### Section 6

Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the FRD; If he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases, the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within 5 Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.

Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the FRD; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.
